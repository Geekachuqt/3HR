### REPEAT3HR

REPEAT3HR is a creative, digital-style mono delay that is designed for time manipulation. It uses volume automation to smoothen out clicks introduced by changes in the delay time.

Every parameter is fully CV-controllable, and works by adding the incoming signal ontop of the knob value. The Crush parameter is the exception to the rule, and here it subtracts from the knob value instead, mirroring the normal usage of the knob.

Finally, it also outputs a trig pulse every time the delayline resets. This allows you to, per example, trigger envelopes in sync with the output of the module, furthering the fun you can have with manipulating the delay time.

### XTENUAT3HR

XTENUAT3HR is a CV tool designed to crossfade two CV signals, and attenuvert them. This can create some really interesting and fun patterns from just two base signals.

The Attenuverter doesn't just apply a -1 multiplier to the signal, but rather fully inverts it - turning +10V to 0 and vice versa.
